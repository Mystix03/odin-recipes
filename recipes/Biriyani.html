    <p>Biriyani, a spicy chicken and rice dish, is one of the most well-known Indian-Pakistani dishes.</p>
    <h2>List of ingredients</h2>
    <ul>

        <li>Biriyanii Rice</li>
        <li>Oil</li>
        <li>Cashew Nut</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
        <ol>
           <li>Once you have your chicken marinated, rice and fried onions ready, start by cooking the marinated chicken. To cook the chicken, place it in the dutch oven or a large pot that you plan to use for cooking the biryani, and cook them for 7 minutes. There is no need to stir the chicken, only flip it once around the 4 minute mark.

            </li> <li>Once the chicken is partially cooked, the next step is to layer it with the fried onions, mint and coriander. The onions add sweetness and richness while the herbs add a ton of flavor and freshness. </li>
